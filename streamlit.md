## Getting Started: Setting Up Streamlit and Pygwalker

Before we embark on our exciting data exploration journey, let's make sure your computer is ready to roll. You'll need a Python environment (preferably version 3.6 or higher) to get started. If you already have that, follow these simple steps:

### Step 1: Installing the Dependencies

Using your command prompt or terminal, install the necessary dependencies by executing the following commands:

```shell
pip install pandas
pip install pygwalker
pip install streamlit
```

### Step 2: Incorporating Pygwalker in a Streamlit Application

Now, create a new Python script called `pygwalker_demo.py` with your favorite code editor and add the following code:

```python
import pygwalker as pyg
import pandas as pd
import streamlit.components.v1 as components
import streamlit as st

# Configure the Streamlit page
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Using Pygwalker with Streamlit",
    layout="wide"
)

# Add a catchy title to your Streamlit app
st.title("Using Pygwalker with Streamlit")

# Import your data
df = pd.read_csv("https://sample.csv")

# Use Pygwalker to generate the HTML for visualization
pyg_html = pyg.walk(df, return_html=True)

# Embed the generated HTML into your Streamlit app
components.html(pyg_html, height=1000, scrolling=True)
```

### Step 3: Let the Data Exploration Begin

It's showtime! Run the following command in your command prompt or terminal to launch the Streamlit application and start exploring your data:

```shell
streamlit run pygwalker_demo.py
```

You'll see some information displayed on the terminal. Access your Streamlit app in the web browser using the provided URL:

Local URL: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

Network URL: [http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8501](http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8501)

Open the provided URL ([http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)) in your web browser and witness the magic of Pygwalker's interactive data exploration and visualization capabilities through Streamlit.

### Saving the State of a Pygwalker Chart

If you want to save the state of a Pygwalker chart, follow these simple steps:

1. Click the export button on the chart.

2. Click the copy code button.

![Copying Code with Pygwalker in Streamlit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/org-ssh-2/images/main/streamlit-3.jpeg)

3. Paste the copied code into your Python script where needed.

```python
import pygwalker as pyg
import pandas as pd
import streamlit.components.v1 as components
import streamlit as st

# Configure the Streamlit page
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="Using Pygwalker with Streamlit",
    layout="wide"
)

# Add a catchy title to your Streamlit app
st.title("Using Pygwalker with Streamlit")

# Import your data
df = pd.read_csv("https://kanaries-app.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/public-datasets/bike_sharing_dc.csv")

# Paste the copied Pygwalker chart code here
vis_spec = """<PASTE_COPIED_CODE_HERE>"""

# Use Pygwalker to generate the HTML for visualization
pyg_html = pyg.walk(df, spec=vis_spec, return_html=True)

# Embed the generated HTML into your Streamlit app
components.html(pyg_html, height=1000, scrolling=True)
```

Remember to refresh the webpage to see the saved state of your Pygwalker chart.

It's worth noting that Pygwalker is built upon [graphic-walker](https://github.com/Kanaries/graphic-walker), a powerful library that can be embedded in various platforms, such as Excel and Airtable. This means that your Pygwalker app can seamlessly collaborate with users in different environments, leveraging the capabilities of graphic-walker and Pygwalker.
